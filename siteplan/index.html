            Chess is a strategic board game played on an 8×8 grid between two players, 
            each controlling 16 pieces: a king, queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, 
            and eight pawns. The goal is to checkmate the opponent’s king, meaning it is under 
            attack with no escape. Players take turns moving pieces according to their unique 
            movement rules—rooks move straight, bishops diagonally, knights in an L-shape, 
            the queen in any direction, and pawns forward (capturing diagonally). Special moves 
            like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion add depth to the game. A match can end 
            in checkmate, resignation, or a draw due to a stalemate or insufficient material. 
            Strategy, tactics, and foresight are key to mastering chess..

            Checkers is a two-player strategy game played on an 8×8 board, where each player 
            starts with 12 pieces placed on the dark squares of their side. Players take turns 
            moving their pieces diagonally forward, capturing an opponent’s piece by jumping 
            over it. If a piece reaches the opponent’s back row, it is "kinged" and gains the 
            ability to move both forward and backward. The game continues until one player 
            captures all of the opponent’s pieces or blocks them from making a legal move, 
            resulting in a win. If neither player can force a win, the game can end in a draw.

        <h5>Text</h5>
        <p>Board and card games are tabletop games that involve strategy, luck, or a mix of both, played using a board, 
            cards, or both. Board games, like Chess, Monopoly, and Scrabble, typically use a playing surface with pieces 
            or tokens, while card games, such as Uno, Poker, and Rummy, rely on decks of cards with unique rules. Some 
            games, like The Game of Life or Clue, blend both elements. These games can be competitive or cooperative, 
            requiring players to strategize, make decisions, or rely on chance. They provide entertainment, social 
            interaction, and cognitive challenges for players of all ages!</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> Dominoes is a classic tile-based game played with rectangular tiles, 
            each divided into two square ends displaying a number of pips (dots). Players take turns 
            matching tiles with the same number of pips on an open end of the domino chain. The game 
            can be played in various versions, such as Block, Draw, and Mexican Train, with the goal 
            usually being to place all tiles first or have the fewest pips when the game is blocked. 
            Scoring varies by version, often awarding points based on remaining opponent tiles or 
            multiples of five. Strategic thinking and tile management are key to winning.</p>

            2 to 10 players take turns matching cards by color or number to be the first to get rid of 
            all their cards. The deck includes action cards like Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, and Wild 
            Draw Four, which add strategy and unpredictability. Players must shout "UNO!" when they have 
            one card left, or they risk drawing a penalty card. The game ends when a player reaches 500 
            points (earned from opponents' remaining cards), but many play single-round wins. Uno is fast-paced, 
            fun, and great for players of all ages!</p>

            can build houses and hotels to increase rent and negotiate trades to gain monopolies. The game ends when

        <h5>Mahjong</h5>
        <img class="image" src="images/mick-haupt-lwXZM3gKxDY-unsplash.jpg" alt="People playing Mahjong">
        <p><b>Description:</b> Mahjong is a traditional tile-based game that originated in China and is played by 
            four players (though variations exist). The game uses 144 tiles featuring Chinese characters, symbols, 
            and suits, which players draw and discard to form specific sets (melds) and a winning hand. The goal is 
            to create a complete hand with combinations like pungs (three of a kind), kongs (four of a kind), and 
            chows (sequences of three). Strategy, memory, and luck play key roles, as players must track discarded 
            tiles and anticipate opponents' moves. Different versions, such as Hong Kong, Japanese Riichi, and American 
            Mahjong, have unique rules and scoring systems. Mahjong is both a competitive and social game, requiring 
            skill and sharp thinking!</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> Jenga is a dexterity-based stacking game where players take turns removing one wooden block 
            at a time from a tower and placing it on top without causing the structure to collapse. The game starts with 
            54 wooden blocks stacked in alternating layers of three. As more blocks are removed and repositioned, the tower 
            becomes increasingly unstable, requiring steady hands, strategy, and patience to keep it from toppling. The game 
            ends when the tower falls, and the last player to successfully complete a turn before the collapse is the winner. 
            Jenga is a fun, tense, and engaging game that tests players' balance and precision!</p>
