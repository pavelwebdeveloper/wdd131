        <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
        <p>
            Chess is a strategic board game played on an 8×8 grid between two players, 
            each controlling 16 pieces: a king, queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, 
            and eight pawns. The goal is to checkmate the opponent’s king, meaning it is under 
            attack with no escape. Players take turns moving pieces according to their unique 
            movement rules—rooks move straight, bishops diagonally, knights in an L-shape, 
            the queen in any direction, and pawns forward (capturing diagonally). Special moves 
            like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion add depth to the game. A match can end 
            in checkmate, resignation, or a draw due to a stalemate or insufficient material. 
            Strategy, tactics, and foresight are key to mastering chess..
        </p>
        <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
        <p class="colored">
            Checkers is a two-player strategy game played on an 8×8 board, where each player 
            starts with 12 pieces placed on the dark squares of their side. Players take turns 
            moving their pieces diagonally forward, capturing an opponent’s piece by jumping 
            over it. If a piece reaches the opponent’s back row, it is "kinged" and gains the 
            ability to move both forward and backward. The game continues until one player 
            captures all of the opponent’s pieces or blocks them from making a legal move, 
            resulting in a win. If neither player can force a win, the game can end in a draw.

        <h5>Text</h5>
        <p>[Board games are tabletop games that involve players moving pieces according to a set of rules, 
            typically on a pre-marked surface or board. They can be strategy-based, like chess and checkers, 
            luck-based, like Snakes and Ladders, or a mix of both, like Monopoly. Some games focus on competition, 
            where players try to outscore or eliminate opponents, while others encourage cooperation, like Pandemic. 
            Board games vary in complexity, from simple family-friendly games to deep strategic ones requiring careful 
            planning. They offer entertainment, social interaction, and cognitive challenges, making them popular across 
            all ages.]</p>
