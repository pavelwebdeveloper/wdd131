        <p>Board and card games are tabletop games that involve strategy, luck, or a mix of both, played using 
            a board, cards, or both. Board games, like Chess, Monopoly, and Scrabble, typically use a playing 
            surface with pieces or tokens, while card games, such as Uno, Poker, and Rummy, rely on decks of 
            cards with unique rules. Some games, like The Game of Life or Clue, blend both elements. These 
            games can be competitive or cooperative, requiring players to strategize, make decisions, or rely 
            on chance. They provide entertainment, social interaction, and cognitive challenges for players of 
            all ages!</p>
